# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Yield Estimator

This project is a machine learning-based tool designed to estimate crop yields based on climatic and agricultural features. By leveraging regression techniques, it provides insights into how various factors influence yield, helping stakeholders make informed agricultural decisions.

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview 
Goal: Predict crop yield (tonnes per hectare) using key climatic and environmental features.

Approach: Exploratory data analysis â†’ Feature engineering â†’ Model training and evaluation.

Tools & Libraries:

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas, plotly

scikit-learn

### ðŸ“Š Features Used
The dataset includes the following predictor variables:

EVI	LST	NDVI latitude	longitude Temperature	Rainfall	EVI_NDVI_ratio	Vegetation_index

Target variable:

Crop Yield (tonnes/ha)

### ðŸš€ Workflow
Data Loading & Preprocessing

Cleaned and handled missing data

Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Crop Type, Soil Type)

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized feature distributions

Assessed correlations and feature importance

Modeling: Random Forest
